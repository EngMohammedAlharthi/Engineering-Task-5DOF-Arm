Task: 3D Design of 5DOF Robotic Arm

This task includes the 3D design model of a 5 Degrees of Freedom (5DOF) robotic arm.  
The design was modeled and exported as an STL file for further mechanical and simulation usage.

- âœ… File: `5DOF-Arm.stl`
- ðŸ“¦ Format: STL (3D printable)

This design serves as the mechanical foundation for future tasks involving electronics and programming.
